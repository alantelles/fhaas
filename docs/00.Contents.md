# FhaaS - File handling as a Service

**Scenario:** You are an on environment where you have to do many file handling. Activities like move, copy, retrieve content, list folder. And these activities are used by many of your services and each of these services may be written in a different language and you have to implement a class for abstract the file handling in each one of these. You want to update some of the access rules for these apps, so you have to update each class implementation.

## You problems are over!

FhaaS is a JSON based REST web service with implementation to do several typical file operations, like copy, move, delete, in addition to retrieve content, list folders and generate file digest. All of this available at a single HTTP request. Your server just need to have access to the target files/directories. You can even make an operation in a separate thread, follow your requester program and get the result of operation when it ends.
